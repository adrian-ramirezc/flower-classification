### What to do during Model Training

- Split the data in training and test set (the training set will be divided in training and validation set for cross-validation)

- Standarize, normalize, ... ?

- List the most appropiate models for the problem. List the hyperparameters for each model.

- Hyper-parameter tuning, cross-validation, ensemble methods 

- Learning curve: By increasing the size of the training dataset, do we improve the performance? Should we invest time and money for acquiringg new data?

- overfitting/underfitting ...
